  # ## Not needed anymore for this test, but kept for future reference
  # # Bug in st_as_sf making check_ring_dir=TRUE have no effect, as
  # # st_as_sfc.SpatialPolygons ignores it. To get around it, need to convert to
  # # sfc_POLYGON first, and then do a separate st_sfc call, which does use
  # # check_ring_dir.
  # # No effect:
  # b1 <- sf::st_as_sf(gorillas$boundary, check_ring_dir = TRUE)
  # # st_sfc gives the proper effect:
  # b2 <- b1
  # b2$geometry <- sf::st_sfc(sf::st_geometry(b2$geometry), check_ring_dir = TRUE)
  #
  # gorillas_sf$boundary <- b2
