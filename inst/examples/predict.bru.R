  # Once we obtain a fitted model the predict function can serve various purposes.

  # The intercept is special in the sense that it does not depend on other variables
  # or covariates. However, this is not true for the smooth spatial effects 'mySmooth'.
  # In order to predict 'mySmooth' we have to define where (in space) to predict. For
  # this purpose, the second argument of the predict function can take \code{data.frame}
  # objects as well as Spatial objects. For instance, we might want to predict
  # 'mySmooth' at the locations of the mesh vertices. Using

  vrt <- fm_vertices(gorillas$mesh, format = "sp")

  # we obtain these vertices as a SpatialPointsDataFrame

  # and that the predicted statistics are simply added as columns

  # Plotting the mean, for instance, at the mesh node is straight forward

  # However, we are often interested in a spatial field and thus a linear interpolation,
  # which can be achieved by using the gg mechanism for meshes

  ggplot() +
    gg(gorillas$mesh, color = mySmooth$mean)

  # Alternatively, we can predict the spatial field at a grid of locations, e.g. a
  # SpatialPixels object covering the mesh

  pxl <- fm_pixels(gorillas$mesh, format = "sp")
  mySmooth2 <- predict(fit, pxl, ~mySmooth)

  # This will give us a SpatialPixelDataFrame with the columns we are looking for
