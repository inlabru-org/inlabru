```


Setting things up
----------------

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(INLA)
library(inlabru)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)
library(fmesher)
```

Make a shortcut to a nicer colour scale:
```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
colsc <- function(...) {
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "RdYlBu")),
    limits = range(..., na.rm = TRUE)
  )
}
```


Get the data
-----------------------------------

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
data(Poisson2_1D)
```

Put the count data in `cd` (just because '`cd`' is less to type than '`countdata2`'.)

```{r }
cd <- countdata2
```

Take a look at the count data.


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
cd
ggplot(cd) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y = count)) +
  ylim(0, max(cd$count))
```

_Tip_: `RStudio > Help > Cheatsheets > Data visualisation with ggplot2` is a useful 
reference for `ggplot2` syntax.

Fitting a Generalised Additive Model (GAM)
-----------------------------------
If you're not familiar with GAMs and the syntax of `gam` don't worry, the point of 
this is just to provide something to which we can compare the `inlabru` model fit.


```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
fit2.gam <- gam(count ~ s(x, k = 10) + offset(log(exposure)), family = poisson(), data = cd)
```

The term `s(x,k=10)` just specifies that as nonparametric smooth function is to be 
fitted to the data, with _no more than_ 10 degrees of freedom (df). (The larger 
the df, the more wiggly the fitted curve (recall from the lecture that this is an effect
of how some spline methods are defined, without discretisation dependent penalty); `gam` selects the 'best' df.)  Notice the 
use of `offset=`. (Refer to slides for an explanation of `offset`.) The variable
`exposure` in data frame `cd` is the size of the bin in which each count was made. 

You can look at the fitted model using `summary( )` as below if you want to, but 
you do not need to understand this output, or the code that makes the predictions 
immediately below it if you are not familiar with GAMs.


```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
summary(fit2.gam)
```

Make a prediction data frame, get predictions and add them to the data frame
First make vectors of x-values and associated (equal) exposures:

```{r }
xs <- seq(0, 55, length = 100)
exposures <- rep(cd$exposure[1], 100)
```

and put them in a data frame:

```{r }
dat4pred <- data.frame(x = xs, exposure = exposures)
```

Then predict 

```{r }
pred2.gam <- predict(fit2.gam, newdata = dat4pred, type = "response")
dat4pred2 <- cbind(dat4pred, gam = pred2.gam) # add column for prediction in data frame
```

Ploting the fit and the data using the `ggplot2` commands below should give you the 
plot shown below

```{r }
ggplot(dat4pred2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = gam), lty = 2) +
  ylim(0, max(dat4pred2$gam, cd$count)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = count), cd)
```

Fitting an SPDE model with inlabru
-----------------------------------
Make mesh. To avoid boundary effects in the region of interest, let the
mesh extend outside the data range.

```{r }
x <- seq(-10, 65, by = 1) # this sets mesh points - try others if you like
mesh1D <- fm_mesh_1d(x, boundary = "free")
```

... and see where the mesh points are:


```{r fig.show="hide"}
ggplot() +
  gg(mesh1D)
```

### Using function `bru( )` to fit to count data
We need to specify model components and a model formula in order to fit it.
This can be done inside the call
to `bru( )` but that is a bit messy, so we'll store it in `comp` first and then pass
that to `bru( )`.

Our response variable in the data frame `cd` is called `count` so the model specification
needs to have that on the left of the `~`. We add an intercept component with
`+ Intercept(1)` on the right hand side (all the 
models we use have intercepts), and because we want to fit a Gaussian random field (GRF),
it must have a GRF specification. In `inlabru` the GRF specification is a function, which 
allows the GRF to be calculated at any point in space while `inlabru` is doing its calculations. 

The user gets to name the GRF function. The syntax is 'myname(input, model= ...)',
where:

* 'myname' is whatever you want to call the GRF (we called it `field` below);
* `input` specifies the coordinates in which the GRF or SPDE 'lives'. Here we are working in one dimension, and we called that dimension `x` when we set up the data set.
* `model=` designates the type of effect, here an SPDE model object from the 
`INLA` function `inla.spde2.pcmatern( )`, which requires a mesh to be passed to it, so we 
pass it the 1D mesh that we created above, ``mesh1D`.

For models that only adds the model components, we don't need to specify the
full predictor formula. Instead, we can provide the name of the output to the left of the `~` in the component specification, and "." on the right hand side,
which will cause it to add all components (unless a subset is selected via the `include`/`exclude` arguments to `like()`).

```{r }
the_spde <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(mesh1D,
  prior.range = c(1, 0.01),
  prior.sigma = c(1, 0.01)
)

comp <- ~ field(x, model = the_spde) + Intercept(1, prec.linear = 1 / 2^2)

fit2.bru <- bru(
  comp,
  like(count ~ .,
    data = cd,
    family = "poisson",
    E = exposure
  )
)

summary(fit2.bru)
```

Predict the values at the x points used for mesh
(the data argument must be a data frame, see `?predict.bru`):

```{r }
x4pred <- data.frame(x = xs)
pred2.bru <- predict(fit2.bru, x4pred, x ~ exp(field + Intercept), n.samples = 1000)
```

Let's do a plot to compare the fitted model to the true model. The expected counts 
of the true model are stored in the variable `E_nc2` which comes with the dataset 
`Poisson2_1D`. For ease of use in plotting with `ggplot2` (which needs a data frame),
we create a data frame which we call `true.lambda`, containing `x`- and `y` variables 
as shown below.

Given that `inlabru` predictions are always on the intensity function scale, do you 
understand why we divide the count by `cd$exposure`? (We will in due course allow 
predictions on the count scale as well.)


```{r }
true.lambda <- data.frame(x = cd$x, y = E_nc2 / cd$exposure)
```

These `ggplot2` commands should generate the plot shown below. It shows the true 
intensities as short horizontal blue lines, the observed intensities as black dots, 
and the fitted intensity function as a red curve, with 95% credible intervals 
shown as a light red band about the curve.

```{r }
ggplot() +
  gg(pred2.bru) +
  geom_point(data = cd, aes(x = x, y = count / exposure), cex = 2) +
  geom_point(data = true.lambda, aes(x, y), pch = "_", cex = 9, col = "blue") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 55), ylim = c(0, 6)) +
  xlab("x") +
  ylab("Intensity")
```

Compare the `inlabru` fit to the `gam` fit:

```{r fig.show="hide"}
ggplot() +
  gg(pred2.bru) +
  geom_point(data = cd, aes(x = x, y = count / exposure), cex = 2) +
  geom_line(data = dat4pred2, aes(x, gam / exposure), lty = 2) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 55), ylim = c(0, 6)) +
  xlab("x") +
  ylab("Intensity")
```

### Looking at the posterior distributions
We can look at the Intercept posterior using the function 
`plot( )`, as below. 

```{r }
plot(fit2.bru, "Intercept")
```

You have to know that there is a variable called `Intercept` in order to use this 
function. To see what fixed effect parameters' posterior distributions are available 
to be plotted, you can type


```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
names(fit2.bru$marginals.fixed)
```

This does not tell you about the SPDE parameters, and if you type


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
names(fit2.bru$marginals.random)
```

this just tells you that there is an SPDE in fit2.bru called 'field', it does not 
tell you what the associated parameter names are. The parameters that are used in 
estimation are cryptic -- what we are interested in is the 
range and variance of the Matern covariance funcion, that are functions of the
internal parameters.  We can look at the posterior distributions of the range parameter 
and the log of the variance parameters as follows. (We look at the 
posterior of the *log* of the variance because the variance posterior is very skewed 
and so it is easier to view the log of the variance)


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
spde.range <- spde.posterior(fit2.bru, "field", what = "range")
spde.logvar <- spde.posterior(fit2.bru, "field", what = "log.variance")

range.plot <- plot(spde.range)
var.plot <- plot(spde.logvar)
multiplot(range.plot, var.plot)
```

We can look at the posterior distributions of the Matern correlatioin and covariance
funcitons as follows:


```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
plot(spde.posterior(fit2.bru, "field", what = "matern.correlation"))
plot(spde.posterior(fit2.bru, "field", what = "matern.covariance"))
```
