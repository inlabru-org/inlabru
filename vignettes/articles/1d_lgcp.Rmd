Introduction
----------------
In this vignette we are going to see how to fit an SPDE to one-dimensional *point* 
data, i.e. data that consist of the points at which things are located, not the number
of points in some area.

Setting things up
----------------

Load libraries
```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(inlabru)
library(INLA)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)
library(fmesher)
```


Get the data
-----------------------------------

```{r }
data(Poisson2_1D, package = "inlabru")
```

Take a look at the point (and frequency) data


```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(pts2) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = x),
    binwidth = 55 / 20,
    boundary = 0, fill = NA, color = "black"
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x), y = 0, pch = "|", cex = 4) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
```

Fiting the model
-----------------------------------
Build a 1D mesh: 

```{r }
x <- seq(0, 55, length.out = 50)
mesh1D <- fm_mesh_1d(x, boundary = "free")
```

Make the latent components for a 1D SPDE model, using an integrate-to-zero constraint for
better identifiability:
```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
matern <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(mesh1D,
  prior.range = c(150, 0.75),
  prior.sigma = c(0.1, 0.75),
  constr = TRUE
)
comp <- ~ spde1D(x, model = matern) + Intercept(1)
```

Here we want to fit to the actual points, and the `inlabru` functions that are
used for this are `bru()` and `like(..., family = "cp")`.
For this special case there is also a shortcut function `lgcp()` (for 'Log Gaussian Cox Process'),
but it doesn't support all features. The standard way of specifying
the function space for integration is via the `domain` argument.

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
fit.spde <- bru(
  comp,
  like(x ~ ., family = "cp", data = pts2, domain = list(x = mesh1D))
)
## Equivalent call for this particular example:
# fit.spde <- lgcp(
#   comp,
#   formula = x ~ ., data = pts2, domain = list(x = mesh1D)
# )
```
Here, `formula = x ~ .` means that the observed points are in `x`, and `.`
denotes a linear predictor that is the sum of all the latent components.

SPDE parameters 
-----------------------------------

We can look at the posterior distributions of the parameters of the SPDE using
the function `spde.posterior`. It returns `x` and `y` values for a plot of the
posterior PDF in a data frame, which can be printed using the `plot` function.
To see the PDF for the range parameter, for example:


```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
post.range <- spde.posterior(fit.spde, name = "spde1D", what = "range")
plot(post.range)
```

Look at the help file for `spde.posterior` and then plot the posterior for the
log of the SPDE range parameter, the SPDE variance and/or log of the variance,
and for the Matern covariance function. Make sure you understand the difference
between what is plotted for the range and variance parameters, and for the
covariance function (which involves both these parameters).

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
post.log.range <- spde.posterior(fit.spde,
  name = "spde1D",
  what = "log.range"
)
plot(post.log.range)
post.variance <- spde.posterior(fit.spde,
  name = "spde1D",
  what = "variance"
)
plot(post.variance)
post.log.variance <- spde.posterior(fit.spde,
  name = "spde1D",
  what = "log.variance"
)
plot(post.log.variance)
post.matcorr <- spde.posterior(fit.spde,
  name = "spde1D",
  what = "matern.correlation"
)
plot(post.matcorr)
```

You can get a feel for sensitivity to priors by specifying different priors and
looking at the posterior plots.

Predicting intensity
-----------------------------------

We can also now predict on any scale we want. For example, to predict on the
'response' scale (i.e. the intensity function $\lambda(s)$), we call `predict`
thus:

```{r }
# Set up a data frame of explanatory values at which to predict
predf <- data.frame(x = seq(0, 55, by = 1))
pred_spde <- predict(fit.spde,
  predf,
  ~ exp(spde1D + Intercept),
  n.samples = 1000
)
```

while to predict on the linear predictor scale (i.e. that of the log intensity, 
$\log(\lambda(s))$), we call `predict` thus:

```{r }
pred_spde_lp <- predict(fit.spde, predf, ~ spde1D + Intercept, n.samples = 1000)
```

here's how to plot the prediction and 95% credible interval:

```{r }
plot(pred_spde, color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = pts2, aes(x = x), y = 0, pch = "|", cex = 2) +
  xlab("x") + ylab("Intensity")
```

How does this compare with the underlying intensity function that generated the
data? The function `lambda2_1D( )` in the dataset `Poission2_1D` calculates the
true intensity that was used in simulating these data. In order to plot this, we
make a data frame with `x`- and `y`-coordinates giving the true intensity
function,  $\lambda(s)$. We use lots of `x`-values to get a nice smooth plot
(150 values).

```{r }
xs <- seq(0, 55, length = 150)
true.lambda <- data.frame(x = xs, y = lambda2_1D(xs))
```

Plot the fitted and true intensity functions:

```{r fig.show="hide"}
plot(pred_spde, color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = pts2, aes(x = x), y = 0, pch = "|", cex = 2) +
  geom_line(data = true.lambda, aes(x, y)) +
  xlab("x") + ylab("Intensity")
```

Goodness-of-Fit
-----------------------------------

We can look at the goodness-of-fit of the mode using the `inlabru` function
`bincount( )`, which plots the 95% credible intervals in a specified set of bins
along the `x`-axis together with the observed count in each bin: The credible
intervals are shown as red rectangles, the mean fitted value as a short
horizontal blue line, and the observed data as black points:

```{r }
bc <- bincount(
  result = fit.spde,
  observations = pts2,
  breaks = seq(0, max(pts2), length = 12),
  predictor = x ~ exp(spde1D + Intercept)
)

attributes(bc)$ggp
```

Estimating Abundance
-----------------------------------

Abundance is the integral of the intensity over space. We estimate it by
integrating the predicted intensity over `x`. Integration is done by adding up
the intensity at locations `x` weighted by a particular weight. The locations
`x` and their weights are constructed using the `fm_int` function

```{r }
ips <- fm_int(mesh1D, name = "x")
head(ips)
Lambda <- predict(fit.spde, ips, ~ sum(weight * exp(spde1D + Intercept)))
```

You can look at the abundance estimate by typing

```{r }
Lambda
```

* `mean` is the posterior mean abundance.
* `sd` is the estimated standard error of the posterior of the abundance.
* `cv` is its estimated coefficient of variation (stander error divided by
  mean).
* `q0.025` and `q0.975` are the 95% credible interval bounds.
* `q0.5` is the posterior median abundance

But it is not quite that simple! The above posterior for abundance takes account
only of the variance due to us not knowing the parameters of the intensity
function. It neglects the variance in the number of point locations, given the
intensity function. To include this we need to modify `predict( )` as follows:


```{r }
Nest <- predict(
  fit.spde, ips,
  ~ data.frame(
    N = 50:250,
    dpois = dpois(50:250,
      lambda = sum(weight * exp(spde1D + Intercept))
    )
  )
)
```

This calculates the same statistics as were calculated for `Lambda`, but for
evey value of `N` from 50 to 250, rather than for the posterior mean `N` alone:

```{r }
Nest[Nest$N %in% 100:105, ]
```

We compute the 95% prediction interval and the median as follows

```{r }
inla.qmarginal(c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975), marginal = list(x = Nest$N, y = Nest$mean))
```

Compare `Lambda` to `Nest` by plotting:
First calculate the posterior conditional on the mean of `Lambda`

```{r }
Nest$plugin_estimate <- dpois(Nest$N, lambda = Lambda$mean)
```

Then plot it and the unconditional posterior

```{r }
ggplot(data = Nest) +
  geom_point(aes(x = N, y = mean, colour = "Posterior")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = N, y = mean, colour = "Posterior")) +
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(
      x = N,
      ymin = mean - 2 * mean.mc_std_err,
      ymax = mean + 2 * mean.mc_std_err
    ),
    fill = "grey",
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = N, y = plugin_estimate, colour = "Plugin")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = N, y = plugin_estimate, colour = "Plugin")) +
  ylab("pmf")
```

Do the differences make sense to you?

Comparison to GAM fit
----------------------------------

Now refit a GAM for the count data of `Poisson2_1D` and plot the estimated
intensity function from this GAM fit, together with the LGCP fitted above and
the true intensity.

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
cd2 <- countdata2
fit2.gam <- gam(count ~ s(x, k = 10) + offset(log(exposure)),
  family = poisson(),
  data = cd2
)
dat4pred <- data.frame(
  x = seq(0, 55, length = 100),
  exposure = rep(cd2$exposure[1], 100)
)
pred2.gam <- predict(fit2.gam, newdata = dat4pred, type = "response")
dat4pred2 <- cbind(dat4pred, gam = pred2.gam)
```

You should get a plot like this (thick line is the true intensity, the thin
solid line the inlabru fit, the dashed line the GAM fit:

```{r results="hide",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
plot(pred_spde) +
  geom_point(data = pts2, aes(x = x), y = 0, pch = "|", cex = 2) +
  geom_line(
    data = dat4pred2,
    aes(x, gam / exposure, colour = "gam()"),
    lty = 2
  ) +
  geom_line(data = true.lambda, aes(x, y, colour = "True"), lwd = 1.5) +
  geom_point(data = cd2, aes(x, y = count / exposure)) +
  ylab("Intensity") + xlab("x")
```
