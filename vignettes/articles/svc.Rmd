## Introduction

Spatially varying coefficient models (SVCs, Gelfand et al. 2003) are
often used to model data when relationships between dependent and
independent variables are not uniform across space, a common situation
when exploring phenomena across large spatial extents (Finley 2011).
Meehan et al. (2019) described an SVC model to evaluate
continent-scaled variation in bird abundance trends. The SVC model
used in that analysis employed discrete aerial units (100 km grid
cells), with spatial structure described by neighborhood matrices and
spatial relationships described by an intrinsic conditional
autoregressive model (Besag 1974). The online supplement for the paper
included code for building the model using the `R-INLA` package (Rue
et al. 2009) for the `R` statistical programming language (R Core Team
2021). Both the manuscript and code can be accessed at
<https://github.com/tmeeha/inlaSVCBC>.

In this vignette, we will describe how to build an SVC model similar
to that described in Meehan et al. (2019), but within a
continuous-space framework. This model will be computed using the
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach of Lindgren
et al. (2011, 2022), implemented with the `inlabru` interface to
the `R-INLA` package for `R`. The
SPDE approach employs a computationally efficient approximation of a
Gaussian random field with parameters directly comparable to those of
a Matérn covariance function. The benefits of a continuous-space
versus a discrete-space SVC include the potential for finer resolution
estimation and prediction, a better understanding of the range of
spatial correlation, and a reduction in boundary effects associated
with discrete-space analyses.

We build the model using a subset of the data described in Meehan et
al. (2019). 
Specifically, we use counts of American Robin (*Turdus migratorius*)
from 
south central North America collected between 1987 and 2016 during
the Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC). The overall goal of the
analysis is to produce spatially explicit estimates of 
annual relative abundance as well as long-term relative abundance 
trends for robins that account for spatial and temporal variation in count effort.  

## Model

The model used to analyze these data assumes that counts come from a
negative binomial distribution with an expected count and dispersion
parameter. The expected count has a log-linear predictor:

$$\log(\lambda_{st}) = \kappa_{s} + \alpha_s + \epsilon_{s} \log[\text{Effort}_{st}] + \tau_{s} \text{Year}_{st}$$

where the natural log of expected count, $\log(\lambda_{st})$, at site
$s$ during year $t$, is modeled with a zero-centered, normally
distributed intercept per site, $\kappa_s$, a spatially varying
intercept, $\alpha_s$, a spatially varying effect of the log of count
effort in hours, $\epsilon_s$, and a spatially varying linear effect
of year, $\tau_s$. The spatially structured effects are modeled as
Gaussian random fields with Matérn covariance functions with range and
variance parameters.

Model parameters $\kappa_s$, $\alpha_s$, $\epsilon_s$ and $\tau_s$ are
analogous to those in Meehan et al. (2019). For example, $\kappa_s$ is
included to account for site-level differences in counts, possibly due
to habitat availability or observer experience. $\alpha_s$ can be
interpreted as an effort-corrected abundance index at year zero.
$\epsilon_s$ is the exponent for a power-law effort-correction
function. And $\tau_s$ is the long-term temporal trend at a given
site.

## Environment

To get started with data analysis, we set up the environment,
by
loading some packages, and
setting some options.
```{r libs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, errors=TRUE}
# libraries
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(tidyterra) # raster plotting
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
library(INLA)
library(inlabru)
library(fmesher)
# Note: the 'splancs' package also needs to be installed,
# but doesn't need to be loaded

# set option
select <- dplyr::select
options(scipen = 99999)
options(max.print = 99999)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=F}
# inla.setOption(num.threads = "1:1")
inla.setOption(smtp = "taucs")
```

Next we define a coordinate reference system (CRS) for spatial
analysis and create a base map for later use. The CRS uses the USA
Contiguous Albers Equal-Area Conic projection, and is identified by
the EPSG code 6703. We modify the CRS slightly to have units of
kilometers, so that distances between widespread count sites are not
especially large numbers (Krainski et al. 2018).

```{r proj, warning=F, message=FALSE}
# define a crs
epsg6703km <- paste(
  "+proj=aea +lat_0=23 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=29.5",
  "+lat_2=45.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83",
  "+units=km +no_defs"
)

# make a base map
states <- maps::map("state", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE) %>%
  sf::st_as_sf() %>%
  filter(ID %in% c(
    "texas", "oklahoma", "kansas", "missouri",
    "arkansas", "louisiana"
  )) %>%
  sf::st_make_valid() %>%
  sf::st_transform(epsg6703km) %>%
  sf::st_make_valid()
```

## Import data

Next we import some bird count data from the GitHub repository
associated with Meehan et al. (2019), and turn the data set into
spatially referenced points. We use a subset of the data (30 years, 6
US states) for this analysis to reduce computing time (~ 1 min). Note 
that site selection and zero filling, important components of trend 
analyses, have already been conducted and this is the resulting data set.

The `inlabru` package contains a pregenerated version of the data subset,
called `robins_subset`, that can be accessed with `data(robins_subset)`,
to avoid accessing the full data online.
The following code was used to generate the subset:
```{r data-extraction, eval=F, cache=T}
robins_subset <- read.csv(paste0(
  "https://raw.github.com/tmeeha/inlaSVCBC",
  "/master/code/modeling_data.csv"
)) %>%
  select(
    circle, bcr, state, year, std_yr, count, log_hrs,
    lon, lat, obs
  ) %>%
  mutate(year = year + 1899) %>%
  filter(
    state %in% c(
      "TEXAS", "OKLAHOMA", "KANSAS", "MISSOURI",
      "ARKANSAS", "LOUISIANA"
    ),
    year >= 1987
  )
```

We load the data, filter out observation sites with less than 20 years of data, add
index variables to uniquely index site and year information, and transform the
coordinates to the `epsg6703km` CRS:
```{r data, eval=T, cache=T}
data(robins_subset)
count_dat <- robins_subset %>%
  mutate(site_idx = as.numeric(factor(paste(circle, lon, lat)))) %>%
  group_by(site_idx) %>%
  mutate(n_years = n()) %>%
  filter(n_years >= 20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    std_yr = year - max(year),
    obs = seq_len(nrow(.)),
    site_idx = as.numeric(factor(paste(circle, lon, lat))),
    year_idx = as.numeric(factor(year)),
    site_year_idx = as.numeric(factor(paste(circle, lon, lat, year)))
  ) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE) %>%
  st_transform(epsg6703km) %>%
  mutate(
    easting = st_coordinates(.)[, 1],
    northing = st_coordinates(.)[, 2]
  ) %>%
  arrange(circle, year)
```

A rough view of changes in robin relative abundance, which does not
account for variation in count effort, can be seen by plotting raw
counts per site and year.

```{r data_map, fig.pos='b', fig.align='center'}
# map it
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = count_dat %>% filter(year_idx %in% seq(1, 30, 3)),
    aes(col = log(count + 1))
  ) +
  geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Make spatial data

Next we use the count data to make a map of distinct count sites and
save the coordinates of the sites, unique and across all years, for
later spatial modeling and plotting.

```{r spat_dat}
# make a set of distinct study sites for mapping
site_map <- count_dat %>%
  select(circle, easting, northing) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  select(circle, easting, northing)
```

## SPDE components

Computing a continuous-space model with `R-INLA` using the SPDE
approach requires construction of four distinct sets of data and model
objects (Blangiardo and Cameletti 2015, Krainski et al. 2018). First,
we create a **modeling mesh**, which is used to provide a piecewise
linear representation of the continuous spatial surface, based on a
triangulation of the modeled region. Here, the same mesh will get
reused for each of the spatial terms in the model. Second, we 
construct an **SPDE model object** that specifies properties of 
the spatial model. Again, we will use the same SPDE object for each 
of the spatial terms in the model.

In plain `R-INLA`, we would also need to create index vectors and projector matrices
(or **A matrices** as they are often called).  However, in `inlabru`, these objects
are created automatically, and the user does not need to deal with them directly.
This works by an automatic creation of a `bru_mapper` object that knows how
to map between mesh nodes and spatial data locations.  Thus, the only two
`R-INLA` functions needed in the user code of the SPDE modelling steps are
`fm_mesh_2d_inla()` and `inla.spde2.pcmatern()`, and the `inla.spde.make.index()`
and `inla.spde.make.A()` functions are only called
internally by the `inlabru` code itself, or rather `fm_evaluator()` is used instead.

## Modeling mesh

There are various things to consider when constructing a mesh 
(Lindgren and Rue 2015, Blangiardo and Cameletti 2015, Krainski 
et al. 2018, Bakka et al. 2018). In constructing one, we balance a 
trade-off between capturing fine-scaled features of the Gaussian 
random field and computing times. Here, we create two non-convex 
hulls around the count sites, and then build a triangular mesh by 
specifying minimum and maximum edge lengths within the inner hull,
and within the slightly larger outer hull.

```{r mesh, warning=F, message=F, fig.pos='t', fig.align='center'}
# make a two extension hulls and mesh for spatial model
hull <- fm_extensions(
  count_dat,
  convex = c(200, 500),
  concave = c(350, 500)
)
mesh <- fm_mesh_2d_inla(
  boundary = hull, max.edge = c(100, 600), # km inside and outside
  cutoff = 50, offset = c(100, 300),
  crs = fm_crs(count_dat)
) # cutoff is min edge

# plot it
ggplot() +
  gg(data = mesh) +
  geom_sf(data = site_map, col = "darkgreen", size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```

## SPDE model object

Next we create an SPDE object to define the model smoothness, with 
prior distributions for the variance and range parameters, and the 
mesh. Here we assume a Gaussian random field characterized with a 
Matérn covariance function with penalized complexity priors 
(Simpson et al. 2017) for the practical range (distance where spatial
correlation approaches 0.1) and variation explained by the function
(Fuglstad et al. 2019). The prior for the spatial range is set such
that the probability of a range exceeding 500 km is 0.5. The prior for
the variance explained by the spatial effect is set such that the
probability of a standard deviation exceeding 1 is 0.5 (Krainski et
al. 2018). If one wants to constrain this kind of spatial effect to integrate
to zero, `constr=TRUE` should be added at this stage.

```{r spde}
# make spde
spde <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(
  mesh = mesh,
  prior.range = c(500, 0.5),
  prior.sigma = c(1, 0.5)
)
```

## Weighted spatial effects in inlabru

In ordinary `R-INLA`, it would be necessary to construct projector matrices for each
model component, that would include the different covariate weightings for
each spatial model component. In `inlabru`, this can instead be handled by either
explicitly multiplying the spatial random fields with the spatial covariates in the
model formula expression, or by specifying the `weights` argument for each
model component specification.  We will here use the latter approach, since
it is the easiest.

In our model,
$\epsilon_s$ is a spatially varying effect of the log of count effort.
Similarly, $\tau_s$ is a spatially
varying effect of year, so standardized year (with 1987 = 0) is also
specified in the `weights` argument. $\alpha_s$ is also an SVC, but it
is a spatially varying intercept. For intercepts it is not necessary
to specify a constant weight of 1. The
model component $\kappa_{s}$ is linked to each observation site and is not modeled on the mesh.

Note that the
current use of the term 'weights' is different from that often
encountered when defining mixed effect models in `R`. Here it is used
to define covariate value multiplication, as opposed to **importance values** for
likelihoods in other contexts.


### Data stack for model fitting

In plain `R-INLA`, we would need to bundle all the model data and component projector matrix
information using the `inla.stack()` function. In `inlabru`, this is done automatically,
so we skip that step.

## Model formula

The last required input for the analysis is the model formula, which
includes information on the prior for explained variation for the
unstructured random intercept. We define the prior for $\kappa_s$ as a
penalized complexity prior (Simpson et al. 2017), set such that
the probability of the standard deviation associated with the random
effect exceeding 1 is 0.01.

```{r prior}
# iid prior
pc_prec <- list(prior = "pcprec", param = c(1, 0.1))
```

Notice that if one wants to constrain a spatial spde effect to
integrate to zero, it should be added `constr=TRUE` in the SPDE model
definition rather than in the component definition. As we want to constrain
$\kappa_s$ and it is a non-spatial term we **can** use `constr=TRUE` in
its corresponding `label()` component definition below, which imposes a sum-to-zero constraint.

The model described above is translated to `inlabru` modeling syntax
as:

```{r form}
# components
svc_components <- ~ -1 +
  kappa(site_idx, model = "iid", constr = TRUE, hyper = list(prec = pc_prec)) +
  alpha(geometry, model = spde) +
  eps(geometry, weights = log_hrs, model = spde) +
  tau(geometry, weights = std_yr, model = spde)
# formula, with "." meaning "add all the model components":
svc_formula <- count ~ .
```
Specifying the `sf` column `geometry` as input causes `inlabru` to extract the spatial coordinate information for the observation locations from. Alternatively, we could specify the function `st_coordinates` instead, but that would extract the raw coordinates, potentially losing important coordinate reference system information.  Alternatively, we can specify that CRS-free information explicitly as input, with `cbind(easting, northing)` or `st_coordinates(.data.)`.

Here, we define the response as `count`, remove the automatic global 
intercept with a `-1`, and then specify the other terms in the model 
with `label()` statements. The first `kappa()` statement defines $\kappa_s$, 
the site effect, as a normally distributed and independent 
(`model="iid"`), globally zero-centred (sum to zero `constr=TRUE`), deviation 
from $\alpha_s$. The second `alpha()` statement defines $\alpha_s$ as a spatially varying 
intercept with spatial structure described by the SPDE object called 
'spde'. Remember that if one wants to constrain this kind of spatial 
effect to integrate to zero, `constr=TRUE` should be added in the SPDE model 
definition rather than in the `label()` arguments. The third `eps()` 
statement defines $\epsilon_s$ as an SVC for the effect of count 
effort, with spatial structure also described by the SPDE object. 
The weights for this spatially structured random 
slope are specified with the `weights=log_hrs` argument.
The fourth `tau()` statement defines $\tau_s$ as an SVC for 
the year effect, with spatial structure described in the SPDE object. 
The weights for this spatially structured random slope are specified with
the `weights=std_yr` argument.

## Run model

We estimate the model with a call to `bru()`. First we set the option
to use the (new) experimental way to do internal computations, see Van
Niekerk et. al. (2022), for the sake of computing speed and better
numerics. In the call to `bru()`, we give the model components, and
specify an observation likelihood with the model formula for
the negative binomial distribution for the counts, and define the
estimation data.
Then we ask
`inla()` to compute WAIC and CPO (temporarily disabled) to evaluate model fit
(also, to save the information necessary for posterior sampling we need `config=TRUE`,
but this is automatically set by `bru()`, as `inlabru::predict()`
relies on it for posterior sampling and prediction). For
computing speed, we choose to use the simplified Laplace approximation strategy
and Empirical Bayes estimation. The `inla()` run for this model takes
about 1 minutes on a standard laptop computer. Another option is to
use the Variational Bayes approximation as detailed in Van Niekerk and
Rue (2021) and Van Niekerk et. al. (2022).

```{r run, eval=T, cache=TRUE}
res <- bru(
  svc_components,
  like(
    formula = svc_formula,
    family = "nbinomial",
    data = count_dat
  ),
  options = list(
    control.compute = list(waic = TRUE, cpo = FALSE),
    control.inla = list(int.strategy = "eb"),
    verbose = FALSE
  )
)
```

## Model summaries

Once computation is complete, we look at the initial results to see
how things went. First we check the posterior means for the
hyperparameters of the model, mainly the variance components and the
spatial ranges of the spatially structured parameters.

```{r vc}
# view results
res$summary.hyperpar[-1, c(1, 2)]
```

Next we examine some summaries of the random effect estimates,
starting with $\exp(\alpha_s)$, which is effort-corrected relative abundance
at year = 0 (1987), given 1 hour of count effort (i.e., log[1]=0). 

```{r alpha_res}
summary(exp(res$summary.random$alp$"0.5quant")) # exp(alpha) posterior median
```
Note that to avoid issues due to $E[\exp(x)|y]\neq\exp[E(x|y)]$, we use the posterior median instead of the posterior mean.

The summary for $\epsilon_s$ shows variation in the exponent for the
effort correction function across space.

```{r eps_res}
summary(res$summary.random$eps$mean) # epsilon
```

The $\tau_s$ summary shows how long-term, log-linear trends of robin
relative abundance have varied across space, from annual decreases of
around 10% to annual increases of around 10%.

```{r tau_res}
summary((exp(res$summary.random$tau$"0.5quant") - 1) * 100) # (exp(tau)-1)*100
```

## SVC maps

Next we create maps of $\alpha_s$, $\epsilon_s$, and $\tau_s$ to
inspect the spatial structure of these parameter estimates. We start
by creating a 25-km mapping grid, and then projecting this mapping
grid to the modeling mesh.

```{r map_grid}
# get easting and northing limits
bbox <- fm_bbox(hull[[1]])
grd_dims <- round(c(x = diff(bbox[[1]]), y = diff(bbox[[2]])) / 25)

# make mesh projector to get model summaries from the mesh to the mapping grid
mesh_proj <- fm_evaluator(
  mesh,
  xlim = bbox[[1]], ylim = bbox[[2]], dims = grd_dims
)
```

Then we populate the mapping grids with parameter estimates (posterior
median and range95), turn them into a raster stack, and mask the raster stack
to the study area.

```{r map_vals}
# pull data
kappa <- data.frame(
  median = exp(res$summary.random$kappa$"0.5quant"),
  range95 = exp(res$summary.random$kappa$"0.975quant") -
    exp(res$summary.random$kappa$"0.025quant")
)
alph <- data.frame(
  median = exp(res$summary.random$alpha$"0.5quant"),
  range95 = exp(res$summary.random$alpha$"0.975quant") -
    exp(res$summary.random$alpha$"0.025quant")
)
epsi <- data.frame(
  median = res$summary.random$eps$"0.5quant",
  range95 = (res$summary.random$eps$"0.975quant" -
    res$summary.random$eps$"0.025quant")
)
taus <- data.frame(
  median = (exp(res$summary.random$tau$"0.5quant") - 1) * 100,
  range95 = (exp(res$summary.random$tau$"0.975quant") -
    exp(res$summary.random$tau$"0.025quant")) * 100
)

# loop to get estimates on a mapping grid
pred_grids <- lapply(
  list(alpha = alph, epsilon = epsi, tau = taus),
  function(x) as.matrix(fm_evaluate(mesh_proj, x))
)
```


```{r map_rast}
# make a terra raster stack with the posterior median and range95
out_stk <- rast()
for (j in 1:3) {
  mean_j <- cbind(expand.grid(x = mesh_proj$x, y = mesh_proj$y),
    Z = c(matrix(pred_grids[[j]][, 1], grd_dims[1]))
  )
  mean_j <- rast(mean_j, crs = epsg6703km)
  range95_j <- cbind(expand.grid(X = mesh_proj$x, Y = mesh_proj$y),
    Z = c(matrix(pred_grids[[j]][, 2], grd_dims[1]))
  )
  range95_j <- rast(range95_j, crs = epsg6703km)
  out_j <- c(mean_j, range95_j)
  terra::add(out_stk) <- out_j
}
names(out_stk) <- c(
  "alpha_median", "alpha_range95", "epsilon_median",
  "epsilon_range95", "tau_median", "tau_range95"
)
out_stk <- terra::mask(
  out_stk,
  terra::vect(sf::st_union(states)),
  updatevalue = NA,
  touches = FALSE)
```

Finally, we plot the SVCs with the following code. We plot the posterior median and 95% uncertainty width ("range95")
for $\exp(\kappa_s)$, $\exp(\alpha_s)$, $\epsilon_s$, and $100(\exp(\tau_s)-1)$.

```{r svc_plot_construction, warning=F, message=F}
make_plot_field <- function(data_stk, scale_label) {
  ggplot(states) +
    geom_sf(fill = NA) +
    coord_sf(datum = NA) +

    ) +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_sf(fill = NA)
}
make_plot_site <- function(data, scale_label) {
  ggplot(states) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(datum = NA) +
    geom_sf(data = data, size = 1, mapping = aes(colour = value)) +
    scale_colour_distiller(scale_label, palette = "Spectral") +
    labs(x = "", y = "") +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_sf(fill = NA)
}

# medians

pa <- make_plot_field(
  data_stk = out_stk[["alpha_median"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nmedian\nexp(alpha_s)"
)

  data_stk = out_stk[["epsilon_median"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nmedian\nepsilon_s"
)
pt <- make_plot_field(
  data_stk = out_stk[["tau_median"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nmedian\n100(exp(tau_s)-1)"
)
# sites kappa_s
ps <- make_plot_site(
  data = cbind(site_map, data.frame(value = kappa$median)),
  scale_label = "posterior\nmedian\nexp(kappa_s)"
)
# range95
# fields alpha_s, epsilon_s, tau_s
pa_range95 <- make_plot_field(
  data_stk = out_stk[["alpha_range95"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nrange95\nexp(alpha_s)"
)
pe_range95 <- make_plot_field(
  data_stk = out_stk[["epsilon_range95"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nrange95\nepsilon_s"
)
pt_range95 <- make_plot_field(
  data_stk = out_stk[["tau_range95"]],
  scale_label = "posterior\nrange95\n100(exp(tau_s)-1)"
)
# sites kappa_s
ps_range95 <- make_plot_site(
  data = cbind(site_map, data.frame(value = kappa$range95)),
  scale_label = "posterior\nrange95\nexp(kappa_s)"
)
```
```{r svc_plots, warning=F, message=F, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# plot together
multiplot(ps, pa, pe, pt, cols = 2)
```
The map for the posterior mean of $\tau_s$ shows that robins have 
decreased in the southern part of the study area and increased in 
the northern part. This demonstrates how the wintering range of robins 
is shifting northward as winters become warmer due to climate change.

```{r svc_plots_range95, warning=F, message=F, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# plot together
multiplot(ps_range95, pa_range95, pe_range95, pt_range95, cols = 2)
```
