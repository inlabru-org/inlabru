\title{Plot inlabru convergence diagnostics}
\usage{
bru_convergence_plot(x, from = 1, to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{bru} object, typically a result from \code{\link[=bru]{bru()}} for a nonlinear
predictor model}

\item{from, to}{integer values for the range of iterations to plot.
Default \code{from = 1} (start from the first iteration) and \code{to = NULL} (end at
the last iteration).
Set \code{from = 0} to include the initial linearisation point in the track plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with four panels of convergence diagnostics:
\itemize{
\item \code{Tracks}: Mode and linearisation values for each effect
\item \code{Mode - Lin}: Difference between mode and linearisation values for each
effect
\item \verb{|Change| / sd}: Absolute change in mode and linearisation values
divided by the standard deviation for each effect
\item \code{Change & sd}: Absolute change in mode and linearisation values
and standard deviation for each effect
}

For multidimensional components, only the overall average, maximum, and
minimum values are shown.
}
\description{
Draws four panels of convergence diagnostics for an iterated INLA method
estimation

\details{
Requires the "dplyr", "ggplot2", "magrittr", and "patchwork"
packages to be installed.
