\title{Pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico.}
\format{A list of objects:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{points}:}{ A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object containing the locations of 
   detected dolphin groups, with their size as an attribute.}
   \item{\code{samplers}:}{ A \code{SpatialLinesDataFrame} object containing the transect lines
   that were surveyed.}
   \item{\code{mesh}:}{ An \code{inla.mesh} object containing a Delaunay triangulation 
   mesh (a type of discretization of continuous space) covering the survey region.}
   \item{\code{ppoly}:}{ An \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object defining the boundary of the 
   survey region.}
   \item{\code{simulated}:}{ A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object containing the locations of a 
   \emph{simulated} population of dolphin groups. The population was simulated from a 'code{inlabru}
   model fitted to the actual survey data. Note that the simulated data do not have any associated
   size information.}

\description{
This a version of the \code{mexdolphins} dataset from the package \code{dsm}, reformatted
as point process data for use with \code{inlabru}. The data are from a combination of several NOAA 
shipboard surveys conducted on pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico. 47 observations 
of groups of dolphins wre detected. The group size was recorded, as well as the Beaufort sea state at 
the time of the observation.
