\title{Create a plot sample.}
\usage{
plotsample(spdf, boundary, x.ppn = 0.25, y.ppn = 0.25, nx = 5, ny = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{spdf}{A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} defining the points that are to be
sampled by the plot sample.}

\item{boundary}{A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} defining the survey boundary
within which the  points occur.}

\item{x.ppn}{The proportion of the x=axis that is to be included in the
plots.}

\item{y.ppn}{The proportion of the y=axis that is to be included in the
plots.}

\item{nx}{The number of plots in the x-dimension.}

\item{ny}{The number of plots in the y-dimension.}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\describe{
\item{\code{plots}}{A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object containing the plots
that were sampled.}
\item{\code{dets}}{A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object containing the locations
of the points within the plots.}
\item{\code{counts}}{A \code{dataframe} containing the following columns
\describe{
\item{\code{x}}{The x-coordinates of the centres of the plots within the
boundary.}
\item{\code{y}}{The y-coordinates of the centres of the plots within the
boundary.}
\item{\code{n}}{The numbers of points in each plot.}
\item{\code{area}}{The areas of the plots within the boundary}
}}
}.
}
\description{
Creates a plot sample on a regular grid with a random start location.
