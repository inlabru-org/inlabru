\title{Simulated 1D animal group locations and group sizes}
\format{
The data are a list that contains these elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{groups}:}{ A \code{data.frame} of group locations \code{x} and size \code{size}}
\item{\code{df.size}:}{ IGNORE THIS }
\item{\code{df.intensity}:}{ A \code{data.frame} with Poisson process
intensity \code{d.lambda} at locations \code{x}}
\item{\code{df.rate}:}{ A \code{data.frame} the locations \code{x} and associated \code{rate}
which parameterized the exponential distribution from which the group
sizes were drawn.}
}
}
\usage{
data(toygroups)
}
\description{
This data set serves to teach the concept of modelling species that gather in
groups and where the grouping behaviour depends on space.

  # Each group has a size mark attached to it.
  # These group sizes are sampled from an exponential distribution
  # for which the rate parameter depends on the x-coordinate
