\title{Simulated 1D animal group locations and group sizes}
\format{The data are a list that contains these elements:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{groups}:}{ A \code{data.frame} of group locations \code{x} and size \code{size}}
   \item{\code{df.size}:}{ IGNORE THIS }
   \item{\code{df.intensity}:}{ A \code{data.frame} with Poisson process 
     intensity \code{d.lambda} at locations \code{x}}
   \item{\code{df.rate}:}{ A \code{data.frame} the locations \code{x} and associated \code{rate} which
     parameterized the exponential distribution from which the group sizes were drawn.}
 }}
\usage{
data(toygroups)
}
\description{
This data set serves to teach the concept of modelling species that gather in groups and where
the grouping behaviour depends on space.

\examples{
# Load the data

data("toygroups")

# The data set is a simulation of animal groups residing in a 1D space. Their
# locations in x-space are sampled from a Cox process with intensity

ggplot(toygroups$df.intensity) + geom_line(aes(x=x,y=g.lambda))

# Adding the simulated group locations to this plot we obtain

ggplot(toygroups$df.intensity) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=g.lambda)) +
  geom_point(data = toygroups$groups, aes(x, y=0), pch="|")

# Each group has a size mark attached to it.
# These group sizes are sampled from an exponential distribution
# for which the rate parameter depends on the x-coordinate

ggplot(toygroups$groups) + 
  geom_point(aes(x= x, y = size))

ggplot(toygroups$df.rate) +
  geom_line(aes(x,rate))
