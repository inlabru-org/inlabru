\usage{
bru_inla.stack.mjoin(
  ...,
  compress = TRUE,
  remove.unused = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{List of stacks that contain vector observations
(existing multi-likelihood observation matrices are also permitted)}

\item{compress}{If \code{TRUE}, compress the model by removing duplicated rows of
effects, replacing the corresponding A-matrix columns with a single column
containing the sum.}

\item{remove.unused}{If \code{TRUE}, compress the model by removing rows of
effects corresponding to all-zero columns in the A matrix (and removing those columns).}

\item{old.names}{A vector of strings with the names of the observation
vector/matrix for each stack.
If a single string, this is assumed for all the stacks. (default "BRU.response")}

\item{new.name}{The name to be used for the expanded observation matrix,
possibly the same as an old name. (default "BRU.response")}
