\format{
A list of objects:
\describe{
\item{\code{points}:}{ An \code{sf} object containing the locations of
detected dolphin groups, with their size as an attribute.}
\item{\code{samplers}:}{ An \code{sf} object containing the transect lines
that were surveyed.}
\item{\code{mesh}:}{ An \code{fm_mesh_2d} object containing a Delaunay triangulation
mesh (a type of discretization of continuous space) covering the survey
region.}
\item{\code{ppoly}:}{ An \code{sf} object defining the boundary of the
survey region.}
\item{\code{simulated}:}{ A \code{sf} object containing the locations of a
\emph{simulated} population of dolphin groups. The population was simulated
from a \code{inlabru}
model fitted to the actual survey data. Note that the simulated data
do not have any associated
size information.}

\description{
This a version of the \code{mexdolphins} dataset from the package
\code{dsm}, reformatted as point process data for use with \code{inlabru}, with the
parts stored in \code{sf} format. The data are from a combination of several
NOAA shipboard surveys conducted on pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the
Gulf of Mexico. 47 observations of groups of dolphins were detected. The
group size was recorded, as well as the Beaufort sea state at the time of
the observation. Transect width is 16 km, i.e. maximal detection distance 8
km (transect half-width 8 km).
