\title{Pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico}
\format{
A list of objects:
\describe{
\item{\code{points}:}{ An \code{sf} object containing the locations of
detected dolphin groups, with their size as an attribute.}
\item{\code{samplers}:}{ An \code{sf} object containing the transect lines
that were surveyed.}
\item{\code{mesh}:}{ An \code{fm_mesh_2d} object containing a Delaunay triangulation
mesh (a type of discretization of continuous space) covering the survey region.}
\item{\code{ppoly}:}{ An \code{sf} object defining the boundary of the
survey region.}
\item{\code{simulated}:}{ A \code{sf} object containing the locations of a
\emph{simulated} population of dolphin groups. The population was simulated from a \code{inlabru}
model fitted to the actual survey data. Note that the simulated data do not have any associated
size information.}

\description{
This a version of the \code{mexdolphins} dataset from the package \code{dsm}, reformatted
as point process data for use with \code{inlabru}, with the parts stored in \code{sf} format.
The data are from a combination of several NOAA
shipboard surveys conducted on pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico. 47 observations
of groups of dolphins were detected. The group size was recorded, as well as the Beaufort sea state at
the time of the observation. Transect width is 16 km, i.e. maximal detection
distance 8 km (transect half-width 8 km).
